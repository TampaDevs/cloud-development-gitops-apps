; This is a defaultFactorio config file.
; It is used when the game is started with the --config command-line option.
; Lines starting with ';' are comments.

[path]
read-data=__PATH__executable__/../../data
; For write-data, we want it to be relative to this config file's location.
; Since this config.ini will be in /factorio/config/config.ini,
; using '.' means the /factorio/config directory. We want saves, mods etc.
; to be in /factorio, so we go one level up.
; Alternatively, since WORKDIR is /factorio, Factorio often defaults to that
; if write-data is not explicitly breaking it.
; Let's try setting it to be relative to the /factorio directory which is WORKDIR
write-data=.
; If WORKDIR is /factorio, then '.' refers to /factorio.
; Saves will go to /factorio/saves, mods to /factorio/mods etc.
